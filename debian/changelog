zaptel (1:1.0.7-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * ACK NMUs. Thanks for helping with this. (Closes: #305731, #310150)

zaptel (1:1.0.7-4.1) unstable; urgency=high

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * High-urgency upload for sarge-targetted RC bugfix
  * Make sure directories are created mode 755 instead of mode 644, as
    this otherwise causes problems for building (apparently on xfs
    filesystems).  Closes: #310150.
  * Tweak debian/patches/Makefile.dpatch fix from the previous NMU so
    that it isn't unnecessarily fragile: -fsigned-char is *always*
    either a no-op or required, so lose the architecture checking and
    enable it unconditionally.  Closes: #305731.
